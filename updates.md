Self-Programming Artificial Intelligence Blockchain / Bitcoin has been progressing steadily over the years, along with advances in computer technology, hardware, memory, and CPU speeds. As computers get faster, more computations can be performed, allowing increasing power for the computation-intensive processing required by many AI algorithms. Our AI Bitcoin core program grows faster every day. The AI has built the first steps for public miners.

We hope to publish soon our ICO included our whitepapers.

Q1 - 2018 - Publishing our ICO.
Q2 - 2018 - Launch of our Artificial Intelligence Blockchain test-net and our coins.
Q3 - 2018 - Launch of our Artificial Intelligence exchange test-net.
Q4 - 2018 - 100% Live running of our Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence Exchange, and the seven coins.

We used mining power to power up our AI. We will accept the first miners soon!.
UPDATE: Some of the mining hardware are not compact with our algorithms.

Thank you,
