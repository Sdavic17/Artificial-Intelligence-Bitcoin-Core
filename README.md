# Artificial-Intelligence-Bitcoin-Core
Self-Programming Artificial Intelligence Learns to Use Functions and developed Bitcoin cores updates.

Introduction

Hi Everyone!,

My name is Davic,

Is it possible for a computer program to write its own bitcoin cores and updates? Could human software developers be replaced one day by the very computers that they master? Just like the farmer, the assembly line worker, and the telephone operator, could software developers be next? While this kind of idea seems far-fetched, it may actually be closer than we think. We have successfully written an AI (C, C++) and is capable of developing its own programs, using a genetic algorithm implementation with self-modifying and self-improving code.

Our project / AI Timeline

Q1 - 2015 - AI successful developed the First Core include test-net.
Q2 - 2015 - AI resolved 762 bugs and developed new features including unique protocols.
Q3 - 2015 - AI analyst several coins, Verge, Titcoin, Ripple.
Q4 - 2015 - AI successful developed 7 private coins, using SHA-256 HASH and Scrypt.
Q1 - 2016 - AI using TOR Nodes for creating the private anonymous coin.
Q2 - 2016 - AI using Twofish and Blowfish algorithm to upgrade security.
Q3 - 2016 - AI using 4 exchanges API for analysis data human behavior and machine behavior.
Q4 - 2016 - AI creates a unique way for calculating miners fee.
Q1 - 2017 - AI runs in beta stage created his secondary storage data backup.
Q2 - 2017 - AI storage size 18 TB.
Q3 - 2017 - AI runs on 7 internal servers including a Network communication matrix.
Q4 - 2017 - AI successful developed a prediction algorithm on few coins.

The ultimate goal would be to produce a network that develop his own and capable of writing its own exchanges and coins include the security of this without any human interference.

Genetic Algorithms

This is the general idea behind a genetic algorithm. A genetic algorithm is a type of artificial intelligence, modeled after biological evolution, that begins with no knowledge of the subject, aside from available tools and valid instructions. The AI picks a series of instructions at random (to serve as a piece of DNA) and checks the fitness of the result. It does this with a large population size, of say 100 programs. Surely, some of the programs are better than others. Those that have the best fitness are mated together to produce offspring. Each generation gets a bit of extra diversity from evolutionary techniques such as roulette selection, crossover, and mutation. The process is repeated with each child generation, hopefully producing better and better results, until a target solution is found. Genetic algorithms are programmatic implementations of survival of the fittest. They can also be classified as artificially intelligent search algorithms, with regard to how they search an immense problem space for a specific solution.

We hope to publish soon the first proof-of-concept that demonstrated our AI.
